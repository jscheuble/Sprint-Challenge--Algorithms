#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n^3) / O(n^2) => O(n) linear
    the while loop increases by n^3, but since the statement below increases by n^2, the exponents cancel out and the runtime is O(n) linear.


b) O(n) * O( log(n)) => O(n log(n)) linearithmic
    the for loop increases at a linear rate to input n. however the statement in the while loop increases at a logarithmic rate to input n. The runtime is O(n log(n))


c) O(n) linear
    The number of times the recursive call is being executed directly correlates to the number of bunnies passed in as input n.
